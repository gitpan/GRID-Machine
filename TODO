* Define functions "greadline" that - when executed on the remote side - reads from the local 
side

* Define GRID::Machine::LIOHandle objects as files on the local side that are accesible from the remote side.
  I.e. s.t. like:

   my $r = $m->sub { tutu => q{
                       my $f = GRID::Machine::LIOHandle->new("titi.txt");
                       my $x = <$f>;
                       gprint $x;
                     }
                   }

* trace : trace communications
#  sub traceop {
#    my $self = shift;
#    if (@_) {
#      my $traceop = shift;
#      $self->eval('SERVER->traceop( shift() );', $traceop);
#      $self->{traceop} = $traceop;
#    }
#    return $self->{traceop};
#  }


* Tests

* Documentation

* Method "call" must specify the context: if scalar or list. Important for IO.

* When installing a sub fields "thaw" and "freeze". By default Data::Dumper and eval

* The "rsync" Method

* Deferred DECISION: 
                allow (or not) pass by reference in RPC?
  S.t. like a prototype
    politely=> 1, varref => "0, 3..5, 9.."

  meaning that variables 0,3,4,5, and from 9 to the end are passed by reference

* args{log}: Ahora se fuerza a que sea relativo al HOME. Si es absoluto que se hace?
  Crearlo si no existe?

* The host variable in "new" can be undef. Fix the bug

* Make code Operating System independent. is_operative rewrite

* Look how slow is package2.pl
